        <ol>
            <li>Combine the lemon juice and salt in a large, nonreactive mixing bowl and stir until slightly dissolved. <br>
                Add the chicken thighs, one at a time, dipping both sides of each piece in the marinade to coat. <br>
                Cover and allow to marinate in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is marinating, purée the onions, garlic and ginger in a food processor or blender. <br>
                Add a little water, if necessary, to get the blades moving.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat and stir in the paprika to color the oil. <br>
                Stir in the berbere paste and cook for 3 minutes, until heated through. <br>
                Add the onion mixture and sauté until most of the moisture evaporates and the mixture reduces, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in the stock and wine, add cayenne to taste and season with salt and pepper. <br>
                Remove the chicken from the lemon juice and discard the marinade. Add the chicken to the pot and cover with sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the whole hard-boiled eggs and continue to cook until the chicken is very tender, 10 to 15 minutes. <br>
